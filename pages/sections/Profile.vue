                                    Essentially, I love to create, make, and build stuff. I spend countless hours sitting in front of a computer screen making something amazing and when I'm not, I draw pencil sketch portraits.

                                    I pride myself in knowing six programming languages, C, C++, PHP, Python, JavaScript, and Java of which PHP is my main game. I love PHP and have been using it for at least six years. So, currently I'm trying to expand my knowledge about the other tools in my arsenal and at the same time, try to complete as many personal and professional projects as I can. Take a look down below to see what I'm up to on <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 focus:text-blue-600 active:text-blue-700" href="#">GitHub</a> and <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 focus:text-blue-600 active:text-blue-700" href="#">BitBucket</a>.
